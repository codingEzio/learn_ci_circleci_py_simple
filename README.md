### Why

- For fun
- Tutorial link: [Python Continuous Integration <small>(on realpython)</small>](https://realpython.com/python-continuous-integration/)

### Principles

- _Indentation_ matters <small>(I'm talkin' about `config.yml`)</small>
- _Typo_ sucks
- Don't be _smart_

### Actual notes

- _Notifications_
  > In the real world projects, the CI process might take a bit long,  
  > it's better to set up a notification procedure to let yourself|your-team  
  > know if one of the jobs fail.
  >
  > > 1.  sending an email for each failed build <small>(CircleCI does it by default)</small>
  > > 2.  sending failure notification to a _Slack_ channel <small>(or anything else)</small>
  > > 3.  displaying failure on a dashboard visible to everyone <small>(hmm.. sounds great!)</small>
